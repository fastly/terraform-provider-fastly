# Terraform Provider release, taken from:
# https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml
#
# This GitHub action can publish assets for release when a tag is created.
# Currently its setup to run on any tag that matches the pattern "v*" (ie. v0.1.0).
#
# This uses a Fastly fork of action (paultyng/ghaction-import-gpg) that assumes
# private key in the `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` secret and passphrase in the `PASSPHRASE`
# secret. We use the fastly fork to ensure safety GPG handling.
