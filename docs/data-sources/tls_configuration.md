# fastly_tls_configuration

Use this data source to get the ID of a TLS configuration for use with other resources.

~> **Warning:** The data source's filters are applied using an **AND** boolean operator, so depending on the combination
of filters, they may become mutually exclusive. The exception to this is `id` which must not be specified in combination
with any of the others.

~> **Note:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search, Terraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return a single key.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "fastly_tls_configuration" "example" {
  default = true
}

resource "fastly_tls_activation" "example" {
  configuration_id = data.fastly_tls_configuration.example.id
  // ...
}
```
<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- **default** (Boolean) Signifies whether Fastly will use this configuration as a default when creating a new TLS activation.
- **http_protocols** (Set of String) HTTP protocols available on the TLS configuration.
- **id** (String) ID of the TLS configuration obtained from the Fastly API or another data source. Conflicts with all the other filters.
- **name** (String) Custom name of the TLS configuration.
- **tls_protocols** (Set of String) TLS protocols available on the TLS configuration.
- **tls_service** (String) Whether the configuration should support the `PLATFORM` or `CUSTOM` TLS service.

### Read-Only

- **created_at** (String) Timestamp (GMT) when the configuration was created.
- **dns_records** (Set of Object) The available DNS addresses that can be used to enable TLS for a domain. DNS must be configured for a domain for TLS handshakes to succeed. If enabling TLS on an apex domain (e.g. `example.com`) you must create four A records (or four AAAA records for IPv6 support) using the displayed global A record's IP addresses with your DNS provider. For subdomains and wildcard domains (e.g. `www.example.com` or `*.example.com`) you will need to create a relevant CNAME record. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dns_records))
- **updated_at** (String) Timestamp (GMT) when the configuration was last updated.
