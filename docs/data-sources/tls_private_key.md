# fastly_tls_private_key

Use this data source to get information on a TLS Private Key uploaded to Fastly.

~> **Warning:** The data source's filters are applied using an **AND** boolean operator, so depending on the combination
 of filters, they may become mutually exclusive. The exception to this is `id` which must not be specified in combination
 with any of the others.

~> **Note:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search, Terraform will fail. Ensure that your search
 is specific enough to return a single key.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "fastly_tls_private_key" "demo" {
  name = "demo-private-key"
}

output "private_key_needs_replacing" {
  value = data.fastly_tls_private_key.demo.replace
}
```
