# fastly_acl

Provides a Fastly ACL (Access Control List) resource. ACLs allow you to create allow/deny lists of IP addresses to control access to your content.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```terraform
```terraform
resource "fastly_service_vcl" "example" {
  name = "example_service"

  domain {
    name    = "example.com"
    comment = "example domain"
  }

  backend {
    address = "127.0.0.1"
    name    = "localhost"
    port    = 80
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

resource "fastly_acl" "example" {
  name       = "example_acl"
  service_id = fastly_service_vcl.example.id
}

# Optionally manage ACL entries
resource "fastly_service_acl_entries" "entries" {
  service_id = fastly_service_vcl.example.id
  acl_id     = fastly_acl.example.acl_id

  entry {
    ip      = "192.168.0.1"
    subnet  = "24"
    comment = "Block internal IPs"
    negated = true
  }
  
  entry {
    ip      = "10.0.0.1"
    subnet  = "16"
    comment = "Allow office IPs"
  }
}
```
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A unique name to identify the ACL.
* `service_id` - (Required) The ID of the Fastly service that the ACL belongs to.
* `force_destroy` - (Optional) Allow the ACL to be deleted even if it contains entries. Defaults to `false`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `acl_id` - The ID of the ACL.

## Import

Fastly ACLs can be imported using a composite ID of the service_id and ACL ID, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import fastly_acl.example xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/aN8uz78RFcmXH0ZJ5l9c3
```

Where `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` is the service ID and `aN8uz78RFcmXH0ZJ5l9c3` is the ACL ID.
