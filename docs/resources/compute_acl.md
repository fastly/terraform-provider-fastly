# fastly_compute_acl

Provides a Compute Access Control List (ACL) that can be linked to a Fastly Compute service. ACLs define CIDR-based access rules (e.g., allow/block IP ranges).

To make a `fastly_compute_acl` available to a [Compute](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/) service, you must create a `fastly_service_compute` resource and attach the ACL using a `resource_link` block, as shown below.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```terraform
# IMPORTANT: Deleting a Compute ACL requires first deleting its resource_link.
# This requires a two-step `terraform apply` because we can't guarantee deletion order.

resource "fastly_compute_acl" "example" {
  name = "my_compute_acl"
}

resource "fastly_service_compute" "example" {
  name = "my_compute_service"

  domain {
    name = "demo.example.com"
  }

  package {
    filename         = "package.tar.gz"
    source_code_hash = data.fastly_package_hash.example.hash
  }

  resource_link {
    name        = "my_acl_link"
    resource_id = fastly_compute_acl.example.id
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

data "fastly_package_hash" "example" {
  filename = "package.tar.gz"
}
```

## Import

Fastly Compute ACLs can be imported using their ACL ID, e.g.

```sh
terraform import fastly_compute_acl.example <compute_acl_id>
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A unique name to identify the Compute ACL. It is important to note that changing this attribute will delete and recreate the Compute ACL, and discard the current entries. You MUST first delete the associated resource_link block from your service before modifying this field.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
