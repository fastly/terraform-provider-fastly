# fastly_object_storage_access_keys (Resource)

Provides an Object Storage Access Key, which can be used to manage resources in various clouds.

Implements the [Object Storage Access Key API functions](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/reference/api/services/resources/object-storage-access-keys/)

-> **Note:** Access Keys cannot be updated, so when you change a value in any of the editable fields the key is destroyed and remade

Basic usage

```terraform
resource "fastly_object_storage_access_keys" "demo" {
    buckets = ["bucket1", "bucket2" ]
    description = "this is a bucket"
    permission = ""
}
```
-> **Note:** Permissions can only be one of these values listed [here](https://quic.fastly.com/documentation/reference/api/services/resources/object-storage-access-keys/#permissions), any other values will return an error
