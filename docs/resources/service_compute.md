  Provides an Fastly Compute@Edge service

# fastly_service_compute

Provides a Fastly Compute@Edge service. Compute@Edge is a computation platform capable of running custom binaries that you compile on your own systems and upload to Fastly. Security and portability is provided by compiling your code to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) using the `wasm32-wasi` target. A compute service encompasses Domains and Backends.

The Service resource requires a domain name that is correctly set up to direct traffic to the Fastly service. See Fastly's guide on [Adding CNAME Records](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/adding-cname-records) on their documentation site for guidance.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```terraform
data "fastly_package_hash" "example" {
  filename = "./path/to/package.tar.gz"
}

resource "fastly_service_compute" "example" {
  name = "demofastly"

  domain {
    name    = "demo.notexample.com"
    comment = "demo"
  }

  package {
    filename         = "package.tar.gz"
    source_code_hash = data.fastly_package_hash.example.hash
  }

  force_destroy = true
}
```

<!-- remove this curated references once https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/28 is resolved -->
### package block

The `package` block supports uploading or modifying Wasm packages for use in a Fastly Compute@Edge service. See Fastly's documentation on
[Compute@Edge](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless)

## Import

Fastly Services can be imported using their service ID, e.g.

```sh
$ terraform import fastly_service_compute.demo xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

By default, either the active version will be imported, or the latest version if no version is active.
Alternatively, a specific version of the service can be selected by appending an `@` followed by the version number to the service ID, e.g.

```sh
$ terraform import fastly_service_compute.demo xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@2
```
