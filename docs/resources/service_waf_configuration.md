  Provides a Web Application Firewall configuration and rules that can be applied to a service.
---

-> **Note:** This resource is only available from 0.20.0 of the Fastly terraform provider.

# fastly_service_waf_configuration

Defines a set of Web Application Firewall configuration options that can be used to populate a service WAF. This resource will configure rules, thresholds and other settings for a WAF.


~> **Warning:** Terraform will take precedence over any changes you make in the UI or API. Such changes are likely to be reversed if you run Terraform again.


## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
resource "fastly_service_v1" "demo" {
  name = "demofastly"

  domain {
    name    = "example.com"
    comment = "demo"
  }

  backend {
    address = "127.0.0.1"
    name    = "origin1"
    port    = 80
  }

  condition {
    name      = "WAF_Prefetch"
    type      = "PREFETCH"
    statement = "req.backend.is_origin"
  }

  # This condition will always be false
  # adding it to the response object created below
  # prevents Fastly from returning a 403 on all of your traffic.
  condition {
    name      = "WAF_always_false"
    statement = "false"
    type      = "REQUEST"
  }

  response_object {
    name              = "WAF_Response"
    status            = "403"
    response          = "Forbidden"
    content_type      = "text/html"
    content           = "<html><body>Forbidden</body></html>"
    request_condition = "WAF_always_false"
  }

  waf {
    prefetch_condition = "WAF_Prefetch"
    response_object    = "WAF_Response"
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

resource "fastly_service_waf_configuration" "waf" {
  waf_id                          = fastly_service_v1.demo.waf[0].waf_id
  http_violation_score_threshold  = 100
}
```

Usage with rules:

```hcl
resource "fastly_service_v1" "demo" {
  name = "demofastly"

  domain {
    name    = "example.com"
    comment = "demo"
  }

  backend {
    address = "127.0.0.1"
    name    = "origin1"
    port    = 80
  }

  condition {
    name      = "WAF_Prefetch"
    type      = "PREFETCH"
    statement = "req.backend.is_origin"
  }

  # This condition will always be false
  # adding it to the response object created below
  # prevents Fastly from returning a 403 on all of your traffic.
  condition {
    name      = "WAF_always_false"
    statement = "false"
    type      = "REQUEST"
  }

  response_object {
    name              = "WAF_Response"
    status            = "403"
    response          = "Forbidden"
    content_type      = "text/html"
    content           = "<html><body>Forbidden</body></html>"
    request_condition = "WAF_always_false"
  }

  waf {
    prefetch_condition = "WAF_Prefetch"
    response_object    = "WAF_Response"
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

resource "fastly_service_waf_configuration" "waf" {
  waf_id                          = fastly_service_v1.demo.waf[0].waf_id
  http_violation_score_threshold  = 100

  rule {
    modsec_rule_id = 1010090
    revision       = 1
    status         = "log"
  }
}
```

Usage with rule exclusions:

~> **Warning:** Rule exclusions are part of a **beta release**, which may be subject to breaking changes and improvements over time. For more information, see our [product and feature lifecycle](https://docs.fastly.com/products/fastly-product-lifecycle#beta) descriptions.

    name    = "example.com"
    comment = "demo"
  }

  backend {
    address = "127.0.0.1"
    name    = "origin1"
    port    = 80
  }

  condition {

    request_condition = "WAF_always_false"
  }

  waf {
    prefetch_condition = "WAF_Prefetch"
    response_object    = "WAF_Response"
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

resource "fastly_service_waf_configuration" "waf" {
  waf_id                          = fastly_service_v1.demo.waf[0].waf_id
  http_violation_score_threshold  = 100

  rule {
    modsec_rule_id = 2029718
    revision       = 1
    status         = "log"
  }

  rule_exclusion {
    name = "index page"
    exclusion_type = "rule"
    condition = "req.url.basename == \"index.html\""
    modsec_rule_ids = [2029718]
  }
}
```

Usage with rules from data source:

```hcl
variable "type_status" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    score     = "score"
    threshold = "log"
    strict    = "log"
  }
}

resource "fastly_service_v1" "demo" {
  name = "demofastly"

  domain {
    name    = "example.com"
    comment = "demo"
  }

  backend {
    address = "127.0.0.1"
    name    = "origin1"
    port    = 80
  }

  condition {
    name      = "WAF_Prefetch"
    type      = "PREFETCH"
    statement = "req.backend.is_origin"
  }

  # This condition will always be false
  # adding it to the response object created below
  # prevents Fastly from returning a 403 on all of your traffic.
  condition {
    name      = "WAF_always_false"
    statement = "false"
    type      = "REQUEST"
  }

  response_object {
    name              = "WAF_Response"
    status            = "403"
    response          = "Forbidden"
    content_type      = "text/html"
    content           = "<html><body>Forbidden</body></html>"
    request_condition = "WAF_always_false"
  }
  waf {
    prefetch_condition = "WAF_Prefetch"
    response_object    = "WAF_Response"
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

data "fastly_waf_rules" "owasp" {
  publishers = ["owasp"]
}

resource "fastly_service_waf_configuration" "waf" {
  waf_id                          = fastly_service_v1.demo.waf[0].waf_id
  http_violation_score_threshold  = 100

  dynamic "rule" {
    for_each = data.fastly_waf_rules.owasp.rules
    content {
      modsec_rule_id = rule.value.modsec_rule_id
      revision       = rule.value.latest_revision_number
      status         = lookup(var.type_status, rule.value.type, "log")
    }
  }
}
```

Usage with support for individual rule configuration (this is the suggested pattern):

```hcl
# this variable is used for rule configuration in bulk
variable "type_status" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    score     = "score"
    threshold = "log"
    strict    = "log"
  }
}
# this variable is used for individual rule configuration
variable "individual_rules" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    1010020 = "block"
  }
}

resource "fastly_service_v1" "demo" {
  name = "demofastly"

  domain {
    name    = "example.com"
    comment = "demo"
  }

  backend {
    address = "127.0.0.1"
    name    = "origin1"
    port    = 80
  }

  condition {
    name      = "WAF_Prefetch"
    type      = "PREFETCH"
    statement = "req.backend.is_origin"
  }

  # This condition will always be false
  # adding it to the response object created below
  # prevents Fastly from returning a 403 on all of your traffic.
  condition {
    name      = "WAF_always_false"
    statement = "false"
    type      = "REQUEST"
  }

  response_object {
    name              = "WAF_Response"
    status            = "403"
    response          = "Forbidden"
    content_type      = "text/html"
    content           = "<html><body>Forbidden</body></html>"
    request_condition = "WAF_always_false"
  }

  waf {
    prefetch_condition = "WAF_Prefetch"
    response_object    = "WAF_Response"
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

data "fastly_waf_rules" "owasp" {
  publishers = ["owasp"]
}

resource "fastly_service_waf_configuration" "waf" {
  waf_id                          = fastly_service_v1.demo.waf[0].waf_id
  http_violation_score_threshold  = 202

  dynamic "rule" {
    for_each = data.fastly_waf_rules.owasp.rules
    content {
      modsec_rule_id = rule.value.modsec_rule_id
      revision       = rule.value.latest_revision_number
      # Nested lookups in order to apply a combination of in bulk and individual rule configuration.
      status         = lookup(var.individual_rules, rule.value.modsec_rule_id, lookup(var.type_status, rule.value.type, "log"))
    }
  }
}
```

Usage with support for specific rule revision configuration:

```hcl
# this variable is used for rule configuration in bulk
variable "type_status" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    score     = "score"
    threshold = "log"
    strict    = "log"
  }
}

# This variable is used for individual rule revision configuration.
variable "specific_rule_revisions" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    #  If the revision requested is not found, the server will return a 404 response code.
    1010020 = 1
  }
}

resource "fastly_service_v1" "demo" {
  name = "demofastly"

  domain {
    name    = "example.com"
    comment = "demo"
  }

  backend {
    address = "127.0.0.1"
    name    = "origin1"
    port    = 80
  }

  condition {
    name      = "WAF_Prefetch"
    type      = "PREFETCH"
    statement = "req.backend.is_origin"
  }

  # This condition will always be false
  # adding it to the response object created below
  # prevents Fastly from returning a 403 on all of your traffic.
  condition {
    name      = "WAF_always_false"
    statement = "false"
    type      = "REQUEST"
  }

  response_object {
    name              = "WAF_Response"
    status            = "403"
    response          = "Forbidden"
    content_type      = "text/html"
    content           = "<html><body>Forbidden</body></html>"
    request_condition = "WAF_always_false"
  }

  waf {
    prefetch_condition = "WAF_Prefetch"
    response_object    = "WAF_Response"
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

data "fastly_waf_rules" "owasp" {
  publishers = ["owasp"]
}

resource "fastly_service_waf_configuration" "waf" {
  waf_id                          = fastly_service_v1.demo.waf[0].waf_id
  http_violation_score_threshold  = 202

  dynamic "rule" {
    for_each = data.fastly_waf_rules.owasp.rules
    content {
      modsec_rule_id = rule.value.modsec_rule_id
      revision       = lookup(var.specific_rule_revisions, rule.value.modsec_rule_id, rule.value.latest_revision_number)
      status         = lookup(var.type_status, rule.value.type, "log")
    }
  }
}
```

Usage omitting rule revision field. The first time Terraform is applied, the latest rule revisions are associated with the WAF. Any subsequent apply would not alter the rule revisions.

```hcl

  type = map(string)
  default = {
    1010020 = "block"
  }
}

    request_condition = "WAF_always_false"
  }

  waf {
    prefetch_condition = "WAF_Prefetch"
    response_object    = "WAF_Response"
  }

  force_destroy = true
}

    }
  }
}
# This output contains the WAF's active rules set. This can be useful for identifying which revision is active for each WAF rule.
output "rules" {
  value = fastly_service_waf_configuration.waf.rule
}
```

## Adding a WAF to an existing service

~> **Warning:** A two-phase change is required when adding a WAF to an existing service

When adding a `waf` to an existing `fastly_service_v1` and at the same time adding a `fastly_service_waf_configuration`
resource with `waf_id = fastly_service_v1.demo.waf[0].waf_id` might result with the in the following error:

> fastly_service_v1.demo.waf is empty list of object

For this scenario, it's recommended to split the changes into two distinct steps:

1. Add the `waf` block to the `fastly_service_v1` and apply the changes
2. Add the `fastly_service_waf_configuration` to the HCL and apply the changes

## Import

This is an example of the import command being applied to the resource named `fastly_service_waf_configuration.waf`
The resource ID should be the WAF ID.

```
$ terraform import fastly_service_waf_configuration.waf xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

If Terraform is already managing a remote WAF configurations against a resource being imported then the user will be asked to remove it from the existing Terraform state.
The following is an example of the Terraform state command to remove the resource named `fastly_service_waf_configuration.waf` from the Terraform state file.

```
$ terraform state rm fastly_service_waf_configuration.waf
```
