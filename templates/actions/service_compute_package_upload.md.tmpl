# fastly_service_compute_package_upload Action

Uploads or replaces a Compute package on a specific Fastly service version.

This action is intended for the explicit/default first-class resource workflow.
It is not intended for automatic compatibility resources such as
`fastly_service_compute_auto`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
action "fastly_service_compute_package_upload" "package" {
  service_id = fastly_service_compute.example.id
  version    = fastly_service_version_clone.draft.version
  filename   = "pkg/package.tar.gz"
}
```

## Usage Notes

Run this action against a single writable service version that is managed by the
explicit/default workflow. After uploading the package and applying all related
versioned resource changes to that same version, run a single activation or
staging action for that version.
