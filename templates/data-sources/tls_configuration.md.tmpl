# fastly_tls_configuration

Use this data source to get the ID of a TLS configuration for use with other resources.

~> **Warning:** The data source's filters are applied using an **AND** boolean operator, so depending on the combination
of filters, they may become mutually exclusive. The exception to this is `id` which must not be specified in combination
with any of the others.

~> **Note:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search, Terraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return a single key.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "fastly_tls_configuration" "example" {
  default = true
}

resource "fastly_tls_activation" "example" {
  configuration_id = data.fastly_tls_configuration.example.id
  // ...
}
```
{{end}}
