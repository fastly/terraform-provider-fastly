```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A unique name to identify the ACL.
* `service_id` - (Required) The ID of the Fastly service that the ACL belongs to.
* `force_destroy` - (Optional) Allow the ACL to be deleted even if it contains entries. Defaults to `false`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `acl_id` - The ID of the ACL.

## Import

Fastly ACLs can be imported using a composite ID of the service_id and ACL ID, e.g.,

$ terraform import fastly_acl.example xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/aN8uz78RFcmXH0ZJ5l9c3
```

Where `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` is the service ID and `aN8uz78RFcmXH0ZJ5l9c3` is the ACL ID.
