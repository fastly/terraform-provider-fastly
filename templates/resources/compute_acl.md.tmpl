# fastly_compute_acl

Provides a Compute Access Control List (ACL) that defines CIDR-based access rules (e.g., allow/block IP ranges) and is accessible to Compute services during request processing.

In order for a Compute ACL (`fastly_compute_acl`) to be accessible to a [Compute](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/) service you'll first need to define a Compute service (`fastly_service_compute`) in your configuration, and then create a link to the ACL from within the service using the `resource_link` block (shown in the below examples).

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

{{ tffile "examples/resources/compute_acl_basic_usage.tf" }}

## Import

Fastly Compute ACLs can be imported using their ACL ID, e.g.

{{ codefile "sh" "examples/resources/components/compute_acl_import_cmd.txt" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
