  Manage CIDR entries within a Fastly Compute ACL.

# fastly_compute_acl_entries

The `fastly_compute_acl_entries` resource allows you to manage CIDR-based allow/block rules (ACL entries) inside a Fastly Compute ACL.

By default, Terraform does not continue to manage the entries after the initial `terraform apply`. This allows you to make changes to ACL entries outside of Terraform using the [Fastly API](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/) or [Fastly CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/tools/cli/)) without Terraform resetting them.

To have Terraform continue managing the entries after creation (e.g., deleting any entries not defined in the config), set `manage_entries = true`.

~> **Note:** Use `manage_entries = true` cautiously. Terraform will overwrite external changes and delete any unmanaged entries.

## Example Usage

Basic usage (with seeded values, unmanaged after initial apply):

{{ tffile "examples/resources/compute_acl_entries_basic_usage_with_seeded_values.tf" }}

Terraform-managed usage (where Terraform controls entries long-term):

{{ tffile "examples/resources/compute_acl_entries_basic_usage_managed_entries.tf" }}

## Import

Fastly Compute ACL entries can be imported using the format `<compute_acl_id>/entries`, e.g.

{{ codefile "sh" "examples/resources/components/compute_acl_entries_import_cmd.txt" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
