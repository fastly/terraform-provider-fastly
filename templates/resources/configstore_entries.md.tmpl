# fastly_configstore_entries

The Config Store (`fastly_configstore`) can be seeded with initial key-value pairs using the `fastly_configstore_entries` resource.

After the first `terraform apply` the default behaviour is to ignore any further configuration changes to those key-value pairs. Terraform will expect modifications to happen outside of Terraform (e.g. new key-value pairs to be managed using the [Fastly API](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/) or [Fastly CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/tools/cli/)).

To change the default behaviour (so Terraform continues to manage the key-value pairs within the configuration) set `manage_entries = true`.

~> **Note:** Terraform should not be used to store large amounts of data, so it's recommended you leave the default behaviour in place and only seed the store with a small amount of key-value pairs. For more information see ["Configuration not data"](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/integrations/orchestration/terraform/#configuration-not-data).

## Example Usage

Basic usage (with seeded values):

{{ tffile "examples/resources/configstore_entries_basic_usage_with_seeded_values.tf" }}

To have Terraform manage the initially seeded key-value pairs defined in your configuration, then you must set `manage_entries = true` (this will cause any key-value pairs added outside of Terraform to be deleted):

{{ tffile "examples/resources/configstore_entries_basic_usage_managed_entries.tf" }}

## Import

Fastly Config Stores entries can be imported using the corresponding Config Store ID with the `/entries` suffix, e.g.

{{ codefile "sh" "examples/resources/components/configstore_entries_import_cmd.txt" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
