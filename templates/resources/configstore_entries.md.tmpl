# fastly_configstore_entries

A key-value pair within a config store.

The store can be seeded with initial key-value pairs but afterwards the default behaviour is to ignore any further configuration changes to those key-value pairs and expect modifications to happen outside of Terraform (e.g. new key-value pairs to be managed using the [Fastly API](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/) or [Fastly CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/tools/cli/)).

## Example Usage

Basic usage (with seeded values):

{{ tffile "examples/resources/configstore_entries_basic_usage_with_seeded_values.tf" }}

To have Terraform manage the initially seeded key-value pairs defined in your configuration, then you must set `manage_entries = true` (this will cause any key-value pairs added outside of Terraform to be deleted):

{{ tffile "examples/resources/configstore_entries_basic_usage_managed_entries.tf" }}

## Import

Fastly Config Stores entries can be imported using the corresponding Config Store ID with the `/entries` suffix, e.g.

{{ codefile "sh" "examples/resources/components/configstore_entries_import_cmd.txt" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}
