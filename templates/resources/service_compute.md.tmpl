# fastly_service_compute

Provides a Fastly Compute@Edge service. Compute@Edge is a computation platform capable of running custom binaries that you compile on your own systems and upload to Fastly. Security and portability is provided by compiling your code to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) using the `wasm32-wasi` target. A compute service encompasses Domains and Backends.

The Service resource requires a domain name that is correctly set up to direct
traffic to the Fastly service. See Fastly's guide on [Adding CNAME Records][fastly-cname]
on their documentation site for guidance.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

{{ tffile "examples/resources/service_compute_basic_usage.tf" }}

<!-- remove this curated references once https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/issues/28 is resolved -->
### package block

The `package` block supports uploading or modifying Wasm packages for use in a Fastly Compute@Edge service. See Fastly's documentation on
[Compute@Edge](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless)

## Import

Fastly Services can be imported using their service ID, e.g.

{{ codefile "sh" "examples/resources/components/service_compute_import_cmd.txt" }}

By default, either the active version will be imported, or the latest version if no version is active.
Alternatively, a specific version of the service can be selected by appending an `@` followed by the version number to the service ID, e.g.

{{ codefile "sh" "examples/resources/components/service_compute_import_cmd_with_version.txt" }}
