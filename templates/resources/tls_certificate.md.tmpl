Uploads a custom TLS certificate
---

# fastly_tls_certificate

Uploads a custom TLS certificate to Fastly to be used to terminate TLS traffic.

-> Each TLS certificate **must** have its corresponding private key uploaded _prior_ to uploading the certificate. This
can be achieved in Terraform using [`depends_on`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/depends_on.html)

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

{{ tffile "examples/resources/tls_certificate_basic_usage.tf" }}

## Import

A certificate can be imported using its Fastly certificate ID, e.g.

{{ codefile "txt" "examples/resources/tls_certificate_import.txt" }}
