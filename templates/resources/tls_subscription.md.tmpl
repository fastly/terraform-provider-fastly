Enables TLS on a domain using a managed certificate

# fastly_tls_subscription

Enables TLS on a domain using a certificate managed by Fastly.

DNS records need to be modified on the domain being secured, in order to respond to the ACME domain ownership challenge.

There are two options for doing this: the `managed_dns_challenges`, which is the default method; and the `managed_http_challenges`, which points production traffic to Fastly.

~> See the [Fastly documentation](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/serving-https-traffic-using-fastly-managed-certificates#verifying-domain-ownership) for more information on verifying domain ownership.

The examples below demonstrate usage with AWS Route53 to configure DNS, and the `fastly_tls_subscription_validation` resource to wait for validation to complete.

## Example Usage

**Basic usage:**

The following example demonstrates how to configured two subdomains (e.g. `a.example.com`, `b.example.com`).

The workflow configures a `fastly_tls_subscription` resource, then a `aws_route53_record` resource for handling the creation of the 'challenge' DNS records (e.g. `_acme-challenge.a.example.com` and `_acme-challenge.b.example.com`).

We configure the `fastly_tls_subscription_validation` resource, which blocks other resources until the challenge DNS records have been validated by Fastly.

Once the validation has been successful, the configured `fastly_tls_configuration` data source will filter the available results looking for an appropriate TLS configuration object. If that filtering process is successful, then the subsequent `aws_route53_record` resources (for configuring the subdomains) will be executed using the returned TLS configuration data.

**Configuring an apex and a wildcard domain:**

The following example is similar to the above but differs by demonstrating how to handle configuring an apex domain (e.g. `example.com`) and a wildcard domain (e.g. `*.example.com`) so you can support multiple subdomains to your service.

The difference in the workflow is with how to handle the Fastly API returning a single 'challenge' for both domains (e.g. `_acme-challenge.example.com`). This is done by normalising the wildcard (i.e. replacing `*.example.com` with `example.com`) and then working around the issue of the returned object having two identical keys.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `domains` - (Required) List of domains on which to enable TLS.
* `certificate_authority` - (Required) The entity that issues and certifies the TLS certificates for your subscription. Valid values are `lets-encrypt` or `globalsign`.
* `configuration_id` - (Optional) The ID of the set of TLS configuration options that apply to the enabled domains on this subscription.
* `force_update` - (Optional) Always update subscription, even when active domains are present. Defaults to false.
* `force_destroy` - (Optional) Always delete subscription, even when active domains are present. Defaults to false.

!> **Warning:** by default, the Fastly API protects you from disabling production traffic by preventing updating or deleting subscriptions with active domains. The use of `force_update` and `force_destroy` will override these protections. Take extra care using these options if you are handling production traffic.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `created_at` - Timestamp (GMT) when the subscription was created.
* `updated_at` - Timestamp (GMT) when the subscription was last updated.
* `state` - The current state of the subscription. The list of possible states are: `pending`, `processing`, `issued`, and `renewing`.
* `managed_dns_challenges` - A list of options for configuring DNS to respond to ACME DNS challenge in order to verify domain ownership. See Managed DNS Challenge below for details.
* `managed_http_challenges` - A list of options for configuring DNS to respond to ACME HTTP challenge in order to verify domain ownership. See Managed HTTP Challenges below for details.

### Managed DNS Challenge

The available attributes in the `managed_dns_challenges` block are:

* `record_name` - The name of the DNS record to add. For example `_acme-challenge.example.com`. Accessed like this, `fastly_tls_subscription.tls.managed_dns_challenges.record_name`.
* `record_type` - The type of DNS record to add, e.g. `A`, or `CNAME`.
* `record_value` - The value to which the DNS record should point, e.g. `xxxxx.fastly-validations.com`.

### Managed HTTP Challenges

The `managed_http_challenges` attribute is a set of different records that could be added depending on requirements.
For example, whether you are adding TLS to an apex domain, or a subdomain will determine which record you require.
Please note that these records will redirect production traffic to Fastly, so make sure the service is configured correctly first.
Each record in the set has the following attributes:

* `record_name` - The name of the DNS record to add. For example `example.com`. Best accessed through a `for` expression to filter the relevant record.
* `record_type` - The type of DNS record to add, e.g. `A`, or `CNAME`.
* `record_values` - A list with the value(s) to which the DNS record should point.

## Import

A subscription can be imported using its Fastly subscription ID, e.g.
