# fastly_tls_subscription_validation

This resource represents a successful validation of a Fastly TLS Subscription in concert with other resources.

Most commonly, this resource is used together with a resource for a DNS record and `fastly_tls_subscription` to request a DNS validated certificate, deploy the required validation records and wait for validation to complete.

~> **Warning:** This resource implements a part of the validation workflow. It does not represent a real-world entity in Fastly, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.

## Example Usage
