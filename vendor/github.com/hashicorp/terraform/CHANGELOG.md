## 0.12.0-beta (unreleased)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* config: `path.module` and `path.root` now return paths with forward slashes on all operating systems, including Windows. This avoids the need to write constructed paths differently for Windows vs. other operating systems, but any existing constructed paths containing backslashes for Windows must now be rewritten to use forward slashes, like `"${path.module}/foo/bar"`. [GH-19708]
* config: `path.module` and `path.root` are now relative to the current working directory, rather than absolute as before. This avoids including a host-specific absolute path prefix on constructed paths, but may show as a diff after upgrade in situations where a constructed path is included in a resource attribute value. [GH-19708]

## 0.12.0-alpha4 (December 7, 2018)
NOTES:
No changes to terraform; this release is only necessary to fix an incorrect version of the aws provider bundled in alpha3

## 0.12.0-alpha3 (December 6, 2018)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* plugins: The protobuf/grpc package name for the provider protocol was changed from `proto` to `tfplugin5` in preparation for future protocol versioning. This means that plugin binaries built for alpha1 and alpha2 are no longer compatible and will need to be rebuilt. ([#19393](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19393))

## 0.12.0-alpha1 (October 19, 2018)

The goal of this release is to give users an early preview of the new language features, and to collect feedback primarily about bugs and usability issues related to the language itself, while the Terraform team addresses the remaining problems. There will be at least one beta and at least one release candidate before final, which should give a more complete impression of how the final v0.12.0 release will behave.

INCOMPATIBILITIES AND NOTES:

The following list contains the most important incompatibillities and notes relative to v0.11.8, but may be incomplete. This alpha release is offered for experimentation purposes only and should not be used to manage real infrastructure. A more complete upgrade guide will be prepared in time for the final v0.12.0 release.

* This release includes a revamped implementation of the configuration language that aims to address a wide array of feedback and known issues with the configuration language handling in prior versions. In order to resolve some ambiguities in the language, the new parser is stricter in some ways about following what was previously just idiomatic usage, and so some unusual constructs will need to be adjusted to be accepted by the new parser.

  The v0.12.0 final release will include a more complete language upgrade guide and a tool that can recognize and automatically upgrade common patterns for the new parser and new idiomatic forms.

* This release introduces new wire protocols for provider and provisioner plugins and a new automatic installation method for provider plugins. At the time of release there are no official plugin releases compatible with these new protocols and so automatic provider installation with `terraform init` is not functional. Instead, the v0.12.0-alpha1 distribution archives contain bundled experimental provider builds for use with the alpha.

* This release introduces new file formats for persisted Terraform state (both on local disk and in remote backends) and for saved plan files. Third-party tools that attempt to parse these files will need to be updated to work with the formats generated by v0.12 releases. Prior to v0.12.0 we will add a new command to obtain a JSON representation of a saved plan intended for outside consumption, but this command is not yet present in v0.12.0-alpha1.

* `terraform validate` now has a smaller scope than before, focusing only on configuration syntax and value type checking. This makes it safe to run e.g. on save in a text editor.

NEW FEATURES:

The overall theme for the v0.12 release is configuration language fixes and improvements. The fixes and improvements are too numerous to list out exhaustively, but the list below covers some highlights:

* **First-class expressions:** Prior to v0.12, expressions could be used only via string interpolation, like `"${var.foo}"`. Expressions are now fully integrated into the language, allowing them to be used directly as argument values, like `ami = var.ami`.

* **`for` expressions:** This new expression construct allows the construction of a list or map by transforming and filtering elements from another list or map. For more information, refer to [the _`for` expressions_ documentation](./website/docs/configuration/expressions.html.md#for-expressions).

* **Dynamic configuration blocks:** For nested configuration blocks accepted as part of a resource configuration, it is now possible to dynamically generate zero or more blocks corresponding to items in a list or map using the special new `dynamic` block construct. This is the official replacement for the common (but buggy) unofficial workaround of treating a block type name as if it were an attribute expecting a list of maps value, which worked occasionally before as a result of some unintended coincidences in the implementation.

* **Generalised "splat" operator:** The `aws_instance.foo.*.id` syntax was previously a special case only for resources with `count` set. It is now an operator within the expression language that can be applied to any list value. There is also an optional new splat variant that allows both index and attribute access operations on each item in the list. For more information, refer to [the _Splat Expressions_ documentation](./website/docs/configuration/expressions.html.md#splat-expressions).

* **Nullable argument values:** It is now possible to use a conditional expression like `var.foo != "" ? var.foo : null` to conditionally leave an argument value unset, whereas before Terraform required the configuration author to provide a specific default value in this case. Assigning `null` to an argument is equivalent to omitting that argument entirely.

* **Rich types in module inputs variables and output values:** Terraform v0.7 added support for returning flat lists and maps of strings, but this is now generalized to allow returning arbitrary nested data structures with mixed types. Module authors can specify a precise expected type for each input variable to allow early validation of caller values.

* **Resource and module object values:** An entire resource or module can now be treated as an object value within expressions, including passing them through input variables and output values to other modules, using an attribute-less reference syntax, like `aws_instance.foo`.

* **Extended template syntax:** The simple interpolation syntax from prior versions is extended to become a simple template language, with support for conditional interpolations and repeated interpolations through iteration. For more information, see [the _String Templates_ documentation](./website/docs/configuration/expressions.html.md#string-templates).

* **`jsondecode` and `csvdecode` interpolation functions:** Due to the richer type system in the new configuration language implementation, we can now offer functions for decoding serialization formats. `jsondecode` is the opposite of `jsonencode`, while `csvdecode` provides a way to load in lists of maps from a compact tabular representation.

* **New Function:** `fileexists` ([#19086](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19086))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* `terraform validate` now accepts an argument `-json` which produces machine-readable output. Please refer to the documentation for this command for details on the format and some caveats that consumers must consider when using this interface. ([#17539](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17539))

* The JSON-based variant of the Terraform language now has a more tightly-specified and reliable mapping to the native syntax variant. In prior versions, certain Terraform configuration features did not function as expected or were not usable via the JSON-based forms. For more information, see [the _JSON Configuration Syntax_ documentation](./website/docs/configuration/syntax-json.html.md).

BUG FIXES:

* The conditional operator `... ? ... : ...` now works with result values of any type and only returns evaluation errors for the chosen result expression, as those familiar with this operator in other languages might expect.

KNOWN ISSUES:

Since v0.12.0-alpha1 is an experimental build, this list is certainly incomplete. Please let us know via GitHub issues if you run into a problem not covered here!

* As noted above, the alpha1 release is bundled with its own special builds of a subset of providers because there are not yet any official upstream releases of providers that are compatible with the new v0.12 provider plugin protocol. Automatic installation of providers with `terraform init` is therefore not functional at the time of release of alpha1.

  Provider developers may wish to try building their plugins against the v0.12-alpha1 tag of Terraform Core to use them with this build. We cannot yet promise that all providers will be buildable in this way and that they will work flawlessly after building. Official releases of all HashiCorp-hosted providers compatible with v0.12 will follow at some point before v0.12.0 final.

* For providers that have required configuration arguments that can be set using environment variables, such as `AWS_REGION` in the `aws` provider, the detection of these environment variables is currently happening too "late" and so Terraform will prompt for these to be entered interactively or generate incorrect error messages saying that they are not set. To work around this, set these arguments inline within the configuration block. In most cases this _does not_ apply to arguments related to API credentials, since most providers declare these ones as optional and then handle the environment variables directly in their own code. The environment variable defaults will be restored before final release.

* There are several error messages in Terraform Core that claim that a problem is caused by a bug in the provider and ask for an issue to be filed against that provider's repository. For this alpha release, we ask that users disregard this advice and report such problems instead within the Terraform Core repository, since they are more likely to be problems with the new protocol version bridge code that is included in the plugin SDK.

* Some secondary Terraform CLI subcommands are not yet updated for this release and will return errors or produce partial results. Please focus most testing and experimentation with this release on the core workflow commands `terraform init`, `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`,  `terraform apply`, and `terraform destroy`.

In addition to the high-level known issues above, please refer also to [the GitHub issues for this alpha release](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Av0.12-alpha1+). This list will be updated with new reports throughout the alpha1 period, including workarounds where possible to allow for continued testing. (Issues shown in that list as closed indicate that the problem has been fixed for a future release; it is probably still present in the alpha1 release.)

  ([#17811](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17811))
* helper/schema: Invoking `ForceNew` during diff customization on its own no
  longer writes any new data to the diff. This prevents writing of new nil to

PROVIDER SDK CHANGES (not user-facing):

* helper/schema: Attribute value is no longer included in error message when `ConflictsWith` keys are used together. ([#17738](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17738))

## 0.11.5 (March 21, 2018)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* core: Ensure that state is unlocked after running console, import, graph or push commands ([#17645](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17645))
* core: Don't open multiple file descriptors for local state files, which would cause reading the state to fail on Windows ([#17636](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17636))

## 0.11.4 (March 15, 2018)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* cli: `terraform state list` now accepts a new argument `-id=...` for filtering resources for display by their remote ids ([#17221](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17221))
* cli: `terraform destroy` now uses the option `-auto-approve` instead of `-force`, for consistency with `terraform apply`. The old flag is preserved for backward-compatibility, but is now deprecated; it will be retained for at least one major release. ([#17218](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17218))
* connection/ssh: Add support for host key verification ([#17354](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17354))
* backend/s3: add support for the cn-northwest-1 region ([#17216](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17216))
* provisioner/local-exec: Allow setting custom environment variables when running commands ([#13880](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13880))
* provisioner/habitat: Detect if hab user exists and only create if necessary ([#17195](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17195))
* provisioner/habitat: Allow custom service name ([#17196](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17196))
* general: https URLs are now supported in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for URLs interpreted by Terraform Core. (This will not immediately be true for all Terraform provider plugins, since each must upgrade its own HTTP client.) [go1.10:net/http](https://golang.org/doc/go1.10#net/http)

BUG FIXES:

* core: Make sure state is locked during initial refresh ([#17422](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17422))
* core: Halt on fatal provisioner errors, rather than retrying until a timeout ([#17359](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17359))
* core: When handling a forced exit due to multiple interrupts, prevent the process from exiting while the state is being written ([#17323](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17323))
* core: Fix handling of locals and outputs at destroy time ([#17241](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17241))
* core: Fix regression in handling of `count` arguments that refer to `count` attributes from other resources ([#17548](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17548))
* provider/terraform: restore support for the deprecated `environment` argument to the `terraform_remote_state` data source ([#17545](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17545))
* backend/gcs: Report the correct lock ID for GCS state locks ([#17397](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17397))

PROVIDER SDK CHANGES (not user-facing):

* helper/schema: Prevent crash on removal of computed field in CustomizeDiff ([#17261](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17261))
* helper/schema: Allow ResourceDiff.ForceNew on nested fields (avoid crash) ([#17463](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17463))
* helper/schema: Allow `TypeMap` to have a `*schema.Schema` as its `Elem`, for consistency with `TypeSet` and `TypeList` ([#17097](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17097))
* helper/validation: Add ValidateRFC3339TimeString function ([#17484](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17484))

## 0.11.3 (January 31, 2018)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* backend/s3: add support for the eu-west-3 region ([#17193](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17193))


BUG FIXES:

* core: fix crash when an error is encountered during refresh ([#17076](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17076))
* config: fixed crash when module source is invalid ([#17134](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17134))
* config: allow the count pseudo-attribute of a resource to be interpolated into `provisioner` and `connection` blocks without errors ([#17133](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17133))
* backend/s3: allow the workspace name to be a prefix of workspace_key_prefix ([#17086](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17086))
* provisioner/chef: fix crash when validating `use_policyfile` ([#17147](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17147))

## 0.11.2 (January 9, 2018)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* backend/gcs: The gcs remote state backend was erroneously creating the state bucket if it didn't exist. This is not the intended behavior of backends, as Terraform cannot track or manage that resource. The target bucket must now be created separately, before using it with Terraform. ([#16865](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16865))

NEW FEATURES:

* **[Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/) Provisioner** allowing automatic installation of the Habitat agent ([#16280](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16280))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* core: removed duplicate prompts and clarified working when migration backend configurations ([#16939](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16939))
* config: new `rsadecrypt` interpolation function allows decrypting a base64-encoded ciphertext using a given private key. This is particularly useful for decrypting the password for a Windows instance on AWS EC2, but is generic and may find other uses too. ([#16647](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16647))
* config: new `timeadd` interpolation function allows calculating a new timestamp relative to an existing known timestamp. ([#16644](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16644))
* cli: Passing an empty string to `-plugin-dir` during init will remove previously saved paths ([#16969](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16969))
* cli: Module and provider installation (and some other Terraform features) now implement [RFC6555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555) when making outgoing HTTP requests, which should improve installation reliability for dual-stack (both IPv4 and IPv6) hosts running on networks that have non-performant or broken IPv6 Internet connectivity by trying both IPv4 and IPv6 connections. ([#16805](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16805))
* backend/s3: it is now possible to disable the region check, for improved compatibility with third-party services that attempt to mimic the S3 API. ([#16757](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16757))
* backend/s3: it is now possible to for the path-based S3 API form, for improved compatibility with third-party services that attempt to mimic the S3 API. ([#17001](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17001))
* backend/s3: it is now possible to use named credentials from the `~/.aws/credentials` file, similarly to the AWS plugin ([#16661](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16661))
* backend/manta: support for Triton RBAC ([#17003](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17003))
* backend/gcs: support for customer-supplied encryption keys for remote state buckets ([#16936](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16936))
* provider/terraform: in `terraform_remote_state`, the argument `environment` is now deprecated in favor of `workspace`. The `environment` argument will be removed in a later Terraform release. ([#16558](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16558))

BUG FIXES:

* config: fixed crash in `substr` interpolation function with invalid offset ([#17043](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17043))
* config: Referencing a count attribute in an output no longer generates a warning ([#16866](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16866))
* cli: Terraform will no longer crash when `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, and some other commands encounter an invalid provider version constraint in configuration, generating a proper error message instead. ([#16867](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16867))
* backend/gcs: The usage of the GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS environment variable now matches that of the google provider ([#16865](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16865))
* backend/gcs: fixed the locking methodology to avoid "double-locking" issues when used with the `terraform_remote_state` data source ([#16852](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16852))
* backend/s3: the `workspace_key_prefix` can now be an empty string or contain slashes ([#16932](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16932))
* provisioner/salt-masterless: now waits for all of the remote operations to complete before returning ([#16704](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16704))

## 0.11.1 (November 30, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* modules: Modules can now receive a specific provider configuration in the `providers` map, even if it's only implicitly used ([#16619](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16619))
* config: Terraform will now detect and warn about outputs containing potentially-problematic references to resources with `count` set where the references does not use the "splat" syntax. This identifies situations where an output may [reference a resource with `count = 0`](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-11.html#referencing-attributes-from-resources-with-count-0) even if the `count` expression does not _currently_ evaluate to `0`, allowing the bug to be detected and fixed _before_ the value is later changed to `0` and would thus become an error. **This usage will become a fatal error in Terraform 0.12**. ([#16735](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16735))
* core: A new environment variable `TF_WARN_OUTPUT_ERRORS=1` is supported to opt out of the behavior introduced in 0.11.0 where errors in output expressions halt execution. This restores the previous behavior where such errors are ignored, allowing users to apply problematic configurations without fixing all of the errors. This opt-out will be removed in Terraform 0.12, so it is strongly recommended to use the new warning described in the previous item to detect and fix these problematic expressions. ([#16782](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16782))

BUG FIXES:

* cli: fix crash when subcommands with sub-subcommands are accidentally provided as a single argument, such as `terraform "workspace list"` ([#16789](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16789))

## 0.11.0 (November 16, 2017)

The following list combines the changes from 0.11.0-beta1 and 0.11.0-rc1 to give the full set of changes since 0.10.8. For details on each of the individual pre-releases, please see [the 0.11.0-rc1 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.11.0-rc1/CHANGELOG.md).

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

The following items give an overview of the incompatibilities and other noteworthy changes in this release. For more details on some of these changes, along with information on how to upgrade existing configurations where needed, see [the v0.11 upgrade guide](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-11.html).

* Output interpolation errors are now fatal. Module configs with unused outputs which contained errors will no longer be valid.
* Module configuration blocks have 2 new reserved attribute names, "providers" and "version". Modules using these as input variables will need to be updated.
* The module provider inheritance rules have changed. Inherited provider configurations will no longer be merged with local configurations, and additional (aliased) provider configurations must be explicitly passed between modules when shared. See [the upgrade guide](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-11.html) for more details.
* The command `terraform apply` with no explicit plan argument is now interactive by default. Specifically, it will show the generated plan and wait for confirmation before applying it, similar to the existing behavior of `terraform destroy`. The behavior is unchanged when a plan file argument is provided, and the previous behavior can be obtained _without_ a plan file by using the `-auto-approve` option.
* The `terraform` provider (that is, the provider that contains the `terraform_remote_state` data source) has been re-incorporated as a built-in provider in the Terraform Core executable. In 0.10 it was split into a separate plugin along with all of the other providers, but this provider uses several internal Terraform Core APIs and so in practice it's been confusing to version that separately from Terraform Core. As a consequence, this provider no longer supports version constraints, and so `version` attributes for this provider in configuration must be removed.
* When remote state is enabled, Terraform will no longer generate a local `terraform.tfstate.backup` file before updating remote state. Previously this file could potentially be used to recover a previous state to help recover after a mistake, but it also caused a potentially-sensitive state file to be generated in an unexpected location that may be inadvertently copied or checked in to version control. With this local backup now removed, we recommend instead relying on versioning or backup mechanisms provided by the backend, such as Amazon S3 versioning or Terraform Enterprise's built-in state history mechanism. (Terraform will still create the local file `errored.tfstate` in the unlikely event that there is an error when writing to the remote backend.)

NEW FEATURES:

* modules: Module configuration blocks now have a "version" attribute, to set a version constraint for modules sourced from a registry. ([#16466](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16466))
* modules: Module configuration blocks now have a "providers" attribute, to map a provider configuration from the current module into a submodule ([#16379](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16379))
* backend/gcs: The gcs remote state backend now supports workspaces and locking.
* backend/manta: The Manta backend now supports workspaces and locking ([#16296](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16296))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* cli: The `terraform apply` command now waits for interactive approval of the generated plan before applying it, unless an explicit plan file is provided. ([#16502](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16502))
* cli: The `terraform version` command now prints out the version numbers of initialized plugins as well as the version of Terraform core, so that they can be more easily shared when opening GitHub Issues, etc. ([#16439](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16439))
* cli: A new `TF_DATA_DIR` environment variable can be used to override the location where Terraform stores the files normally placed in the `.terraform` directory. ([#16207](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16207))
* provider/terraform: now built in to Terraform Core so that it will always have the same backend functionality as the Terraform release it corresponds to. ([#16543](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16543))

BUG FIXES:

* config: Provider config in submodules will no longer be overridden by parent providers with the same name. ([#16379](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16379))
* cli: When remote state is enabled, Terraform will no longer generate a local `terraform.tfstate.backup` file before updating remote state. ([#16464](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16464))
* core: state now includes a reference to the provider configuration most recently used to create or update a resource, so that the same configuration can be used to destroy that resource if its configuration (including the explicit pointer to a provider configuration) is removed ([#16586](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16586))
* core: Module outputs can now produce errors, preventing them from silently propagating through the config. ([#16204](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16204))
* backend/gcs: will now automatically add a slash to the given prefix if not present, since without it the workspace enumeration does not function correctly ([#16585](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16585))

PROVIDER FRAMEWORK CHANGES (not user-facing):

* helper/schema: Loosen validation for 'id' field ([#16456](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16456))

## 0.10.8 (October 25, 2017)

NEW FEATURES:

* **New `etcdv3` backend**, for use with the newer etcd api ([#15680](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15680))
* **New interpolation function `chunklist`**, for spliting a list into a list of lists with specified sublist chunk sizes. ([#15112](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15112))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* backend/s3: Add options to skip AWS validation which allows non-AWS S3 backends ([#15553](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15553))

BUG FIXES:

* command/validate: Respect `-plugin-dir` overridden plugin paths in the `terraform validate` command. ([#15985](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15985))
* provisioner/chef: Clean clients from `chef-vault` when `recreate_client` enabled ([#16357](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16357))
* communicator/winrm: Support the `cacert` option for custom certificate authorities when provisioning over WinRM ([#14783](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14783))

## 0.10.7 (October 2, 2017)

NEW FEATURES:

* Provider plugins can now optionally be cached in a shared directory to avoid re-downloading them for each configuration working directory. For more information, see [the documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/34956cd12449cb77db3f55e3286cd369e8332eeb/website/docs/configuration/providers.html.md#provider-plugin-cache). ([#16000](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16000))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* config: New `abs` interpolation function, returning the absolute value of a number ([#16168](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16168))
* config: New `transpose` interpolation function, which swaps the keys and values in a map of lists of strings. ([#16192](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16192))
* cli: The Terraform CLI now supports tab-completion for commands and certain arguments for `bash` and `zsh` users. See [the tab-completion docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/2c782e60fad78e6fc976d850162322608f074e57/website/docs/commands/index.html.markdown#shell-tab-completion) for information on how to enable it. ([#16176](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16176))
* cli: `terraform state rm` now includes in its output the count of resources that were removed from the state. ([#16137](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16137))

BUG FIXES:

* modules: Update go-getter to fix crash when fetching invalid source subdir ([#16161](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16161))
* modules: Fix regression in the handling of modules sourcing other modules with relative paths ([#16160](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16160))
* core: Skip local value interpolation during destroy ([#16213](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16213))

## 0.10.6 (September 19, 2017)

UPGRADE NOTES:

* The internal storage of modules has changed in this release, so after
  upgrading `terraform init` must be run to re-install modules in the new
  on-disk format. The existing installed versions of modules will be ignored,
  so the latest version of each module will be installed.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Modules can now be installed from [the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)
* cli: `terraform import` now accepts an option `-allow-missing-config` that overrides the default requirement that a configuration block must already be present for the resource being imported. ([#15876](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15876))

## 0.10.5 (September 14, 2017)

NEW FEATURES:

* config: `indent` interpolation function appends spaces to all but the first line of a multi-line string ([#15311](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15311))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* cli: `terraform fmt` has a new option `-check` which makes it return a non-zero exit status if any formatting changes are required ([#15387](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15387))
* cli: When [running Terraform in automation](https://www.terraform.io/guides/running-terraform-in-automation.html), a new environment variable `TF_IN_AUTOMATION` can be used to disable or adjust certain prompts that would normally include specific CLI commands to run. This assumes that the wrapping automation tool is providing its own UI for guiding the user through the workflow, and thus the standard advice would be redundant and/or confusing. ([#16059](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16059))

BUG FIXES:

* cli: restore the "(forces new resource)" annotations on attributes that were inadvertently disabled in 0.10.4. ([#16067](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16067))
* cli: fix regression with installing modules from git when the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` environment variable is set ([#16099](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16099))

## 0.10.4 (September 6, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:
* `terraform apply` now uses the standard resource address syntax to refer to resources in its log ([#15884](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15884))
* `terraform plan` output has some minor adjustments to improve readability and accessibility for those who can't see its colors ([#15884](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15884))

BUG FIXES:

* backend/consul: fix crash during consul backend initialization ([#15976](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15976))
* backend/azurerm: ensure that blob storage metadata is preserved when updating state blobs, to avoid losing track of lock metadata ([#16015](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16015))
* config: local values now work properly in resource `count` and in modules with more than one `.tf` file ([#15995](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15995)] [[#15982](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15982))
* cli: removed some inconsistencies in how data sources are counted and tallied in plan vs. apply and apply vs. destroy. In particular, data sources are no longer incorrectly counted as destroyed in `terraform destroy` ([#15884](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15884))

## 0.10.3 (August 30, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* LGPL Dependencies Removed ([#15862](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15862))

NEW FEATURES:

* **Local Values**: this new configuration language feature allows assigning a symbolic local name to an expression so it can be used multiple times in configuration without repetition. See [the documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/website/docs/configuration/locals.html.md) for how to define and use local values. ([#15449](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15449))
* **`base64gzip` interpolation function**: compresses a string with gzip and then base64-encodes the result ([#3858](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/3858))
* **`flatten` interpolation function**: turns a list of lists, or list of lists of lists, etc into a flat list of primitive values ([#15278](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15278))
* **`urlencode` interpolation function**: applies standard URL encoding to a string so that it can be embedded in a URL without making it invalid and without any of the characters being interpreted as part of the URL structure ([#15871](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15871))
* **`salt-masterless` provisioner**: runs Salt in masterless mode on a target server ([#14720](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14720))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* config: The `jsonencode` interpolation function now accepts nested list and map structures, where before it would accept only strings, lists of strings, and maps of strings. ([#14884](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14884))
* cli: The "creation complete" (and similar) messages from `terraform apply` now include a total elapsed time for each operation. ([#15548](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15548))
* cli: Module installation (with either `terraform init` or `terraform get`) now detects and recursively initializes submodules when the source is a git repository. ([#15891](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15891))
* cli: Modules can now be installed from `.tar.xz` archives, in addition to the existing `.tar.gz`, `.tar.bz2` and `.zip`. ([#15891](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15891))
* provisioner/local-exec: now possible to specify a custom "interpreter", overriding the default of either `bash -c` (on Unix) or `cmd.exe /C` (on Windows) ([#15166](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15166))
* backend/consul: can now set the path to a specific CA certificate file, client certificate file, and client key file that will be used when configuring the underlying Consul client. ([#15405](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15405))
* backend/http: now has optional support for locking, with special support from the target server. Additionally, the update operation can now optionally be implemented via `PUT` rather than `POST`. ([#15793](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15793))
* helper/resource: Add `TestStep.SkipFunc` ([#15957](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15957))

BUG FIXES:

* cli: `terraform init` now verifies the required Terraform version from the root module config. Previously this was verified only on subsequent commands, after initialization. ([#15935](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15935))
* cli: `terraform validate` now consults `terraform.tfvars`, if present, to set variable values. This is now consistent with the behavior of other commands. ([#15938](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15938))

## 0.10.2 (August 16, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

* tools/terraform-bundle: Add missing Ui to ProviderInstaller (fix crash) ([#15826](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15826))
* go-plugin: don't crash when server emits non-key-value JSON ([go-plugin#43](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin/pull/43))

## 0.10.1 (August 15, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

* Fix `terraform state rm` and `mv` commands to work correctly with remote state backends ([#15652](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15652))
* Fix errors when interpolations fail during input ([#15780](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15780))
* Backoff retries in remote-execution provisioner ([#15772](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15772))
* Load plugins from `~/.terraform.d/plugins/OS_ARCH/` and `.terraformrc` ([#15769](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15769))
* The `import` command was ignoring the remote state configuration ([#15768](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15768))
* Don't allow leading slashes in s3 bucket names for remote state ([#15738](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15738))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* helper/schema: Add `GetOkExists` schema function ([#15723](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15723))
* helper/schema: Make 'id' a reserved field name ([#15695](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15695))
* command/init: Display version + source when initializing plugins ([#15804](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15804))

INTERNAL CHANGES:

## 0.10.0 (August 2, 2017)

**This is the complete 0.9.11 to 0.10.0 CHANGELOG**

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* A new flag `-auto-approve` has been added to `terraform apply`. This flag controls whether an interactive approval is applied before
  making the changes in the plan. For now this flag defaults to `true` to preserve previous behavior, but this will become the new default
  in a future version. We suggest that anyone running `terraform apply` in wrapper scripts or automation refer to the upgrade guide to learn
  how to prepare such wrapper scripts for the later breaking change.
* The `validate` command now checks that all variables are specified by default.  The validation will fail by default if that's not the
  case. ([#13872](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13872))
* `terraform state rm` now requires at least one argument. Previously, calling it with no arguments would remove all resources from state,
  which is consistent with the other `terraform state` commands but unlikely enough that we considered it better to be inconsistent here to
  reduce the risk of accidentally destroying the state.
* Terraform providers are no longer distributed as part of the main Terraform distribution. Instead, they are installed automatically as
  part of running `terraform init`. It is therefore now mandatory to run `terraform init` before any other operations that use provider
  plugins, to ensure that the required plugins are installed and properly initialized.
* The `terraform env` family of commands have been renamed to `terraform workspace`, in response to feedback that the previous naming was
  confusing due to collisions with other concepts of the same name. The commands still work the same as they did before, and the `env`
  subcommand is still supported as an alias for backward compatibility. The `env` subcommand will be removed altogether in a future release,
  so it's recommended to update any automation or wrapper scripts that use these commands.
* The `terraform init` subcommand no longer takes a SOURCE argument to copy to the current directory. The behavior has been changed to match
  that of `plan` and `apply`, so that a configuration can be provided as an argument on the commandline while initializing the current
  directory. If a module needs to be copied into the current directory before initialization, it will have to be done manually.
* The `-target` option available on several Terraform subcommands has changed behavior and **now matches potentially more resources**.  In
  particular, given an option `-target=module.foo`, resources in any descendent modules of `foo` will also be targeted, where before this
  was not true. After upgrading, be sure to look carefully at the set of changes proposed by `terraform plan` when using `-target` to ensure
  that the target is being interpreted as expected. Note that the `-target` argument is offered for exceptional circumstances only and is
  not intended for routine use.
* The `import` command requires that imported resources be specified in the configuration file. Previously, users were encouraged to import
  a resource and _then_ write the configuration block for it. This creates the risk that users could import a resource and subsequently
  create no configuration for it, which results in Terraform deleting the resource. If the imported resource is not present in the
  configuration file, the `import` command will fail.

FEATURES:

* **Separate Provider Releases:** Providers are now released independently from Terraform.
* **Automatic Provider Installation:** The required providers will be automatically installed during `terraform init`.
* **Provider Constraints:** Provider are now versioned, and version constraints may be declared in the configuration.

PROVIDERS:

* Providers now maintain their own CHANGELOGs in their respective repositories: [terraform-providers](https://github.com/terraform-providers)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* cli: Add a `-from-module` flag to `terraform init` to re-introduce the legacy `terraform init` behavior of fetching a module. ([#15666](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15666))
* backend/s3: Add `workspace_key_prefix` to allow a user-configurable prefix for workspaces in the S3 Backend. ([#15370](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15370))
* cli: `terraform apply` now has an option `-auto-approve=false` that produces an interactive prompt to approve the generated plan. This will become the default workflow in a future Terraform version. ([#7251](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/7251))
* cli: `terraform workspace show` command prints the current workspace name in a way that's more convenient for processing in wrapper scripts. ([#15157](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15157))
* cli: `terraform state rm` will now generate an error if no arguments are passed, whereas before it treated it as an open resource address selecting _all_ resources ([#15283](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15283))
* cli: Files in the config directory ending in `.auto.tfvars` are now loaded automatically (in lexicographical order) in addition to the single `terraform.tfvars` file that auto-loaded previously. ([#13306](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13306))
* Providers no longer in the main Terraform distribution; installed automatically by init instead ([#15208](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15208))
* cli: `terraform env` command renamed to `terraform workspace` ([#14952](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14952))
* cli: `terraform init` command now has `-upgrade` option to download the latest versions (within specified constraints) of modules and provider plugins.
* cli: The `-target` option to various Terraform operation can now target resources in descendent modules. ([#15314](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15314))
* cli: Minor updates to `terraform plan` output: use standard resource address syntax, more visually-distinct `-/+` actions, and more ([#15362](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15362))
* config: New interpolation function `contains`, to find if a given string exists in a list of strings. ([#15322](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15322))

BUG FIXES:

* provisioner/chef: fix panic ([#15617](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15617))
* Don't show a message about the path to the state file if the state is remote ([#15435](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15435))
* Fix crash when `terraform graph` is run with no configuration ([#15588](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15588))
* Handle correctly the `.exe` suffix on locally-compiled provider plugins on Windows systems. ([#15587](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15587))
* config: Fixed a parsing issue in the interpolation language HIL that was causing misinterpretation of literal strings ending with escaped backslashes ([#15415](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15415))
* core: the S3 Backend was failing to remove the state file checksums from DynamoDB when deleting a workspace ([#15383](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15383))
* core: Improved reslience against crashes for a certain kind of inconsistency in the representation of list values in state. ([#15390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15390))
* core: Display correct to and from backends in copy message when migrating to new remote state ([#15318](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15318))
* core: Fix a regression from 0.9.6 that was causing the tally of resources to create to be double-counted sometimes in the plan output ([#15344](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15344))
* cli: the state `rm` and `mv` commands were always loading a state from a Backend, and ignoring the `-state` flag ([#15388](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15388))
* cli: certain prompts in `terraform init` were respecting `-input=false` but not the `TF_INPUT` environment variable ([#15391](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15391))
* state: Further work, building on [#15423](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15423), to improve the internal design of the state managers to make this code more maintainable and reduce the risk of regressions; this may lead to slight changes to the number of times Terraform writes to remote state and how the serial is implemented with respect to those writes, which does not affect outward functionality but is worth noting if you log or inspect state updates for debugging purposes.
* config: Interpolation function `cidrhost` was not correctly calcluating host addresses under IPv6 CIDR prefixes ([#15321](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15321))
* provisioner/chef: Prevent a panic while trying to read the connection info ([#15271](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15271))

* provisioner/file: Refactor the provisioner validation function to prevent false positives ([#15273](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15273))

## 0.9.11 (Jul 3, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

* core: Hotfix for issue where a state from a plan was reported as not equal to the same state stored to a backend. This arose from the fix for the previous issue where the incorrect copy of the state was being used when applying with a plan. ([#15460](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15460))


## 0.9.10 (June 29, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

* core: Hotfix for issue where state index wasn't getting properly incremented when applying a change containing only data source updates and/or resource drift. (That is, state changes made during refresh.)
  This issue is significant only for the "atlas" backend, since that backend verifies on the server that state serial numbers are being used consistently. ([#15423](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15423))

## 0.9.9 (June 26, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

 * provisioner/file: Refactor the provisioner validation function to prevent false positives ([#15273](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15273)))
 * provisioner/chef: Prevent a panic while trying to read the connection info ([#15271](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15271)))

## 0.9.8 (June 7, 2017)

NOTE:

* The 0.9.7 release had a bug with its new feature of periodically persisting state to the backend during an apply, as part of [[#14834](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14834)]. This change has been reverted in this release and will be re-introduced at a later time once it has been made to work properly.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* provider/google: `network` argument in `google_compute_instance_group` is now optional ([#13493](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13493))
* provider/google: Add support for `draining_timeout_sec` to `google_compute_backend_service`. ([#14559](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14559))

BUG FIXES:

* provider/aws: fixed reading network configurations for `spot_fleet_request` ([#13748](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13748))

## 0.9.7 (June 7, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The `lock_table` attribute in the S3 backend configuration has been deprecated in favor of `dynamodb_table`, which better reflects that the table is no longer only used for locks. ([#14949](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14949))

 * **New Resource:** `digitalocean_certificate` ([#14578](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14578))
 * **New Resource:** `vcd_edgegateway_vpn` ([#13123](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13123))
 * **New Resource:** `vault_mount` ([#14456](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14456))
 * **New Interpolation Function:** `bcrypt` ([#14725](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14725))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* backend/consul: Storing state to Consul now uses Check-And-Set (CAS) by default to avoid inconsistent state, and will automatically attempt to re-acquire a lock if it is lost during Terraform execution. ([#14930](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14930))

## 0.9.6 (May 25, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* When assigning a "splat variable" to a resource attribute, like `foo = "${some_resource.foo.*.baz}"`, it is no longer required (nor recommended) to wrap the string in list brackets. The extra brackets continue to be allowed for resource attributes for compatibility, but this will cease to be allowed in a future version. ([#14737](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14737))
* provider/aws: Allow lightsail resources to work in other regions. Previously Terraform would automatically configure lightsail resources to run solely in `us-east-1`. This means that if a provider was initialized with a different region than `us-east-1`, users will need to create a provider alias to maintain their lightsail resources in us-east-1 [[#14685](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14685)].
* provider/aws: Users of `aws_cloudfront_distribution` `default_cache_behavior` will notice that cookies is now a required value - even if that value is none ([#12628](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12628))
* provider/google: Users of `google_compute_health_check` who were not setting a value for the `host` property of `http_health_check` or `https_health_check` previously had a faulty default value. This has been fixed and will show as a change in terraform plan/apply. ([#14441](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/14441))

## 0.9.5 (May 11, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* provider/aws: Users of aws_cloudfront_distributions with custom_origins have been broken due to changes in the AWS API requiring   `OriginReadTimeout` being set for updates.

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:
 * provider/aws: Fix a critical bug in `aws_emr_cluster` in order to preserve the ordering
   of any arguments in `bootstrap_action`. Terraform will now enforce the ordering
   from the configuration. As a result, `aws_emr_cluster` resources may need to be
   recreated, as there is no API to update them in-place ([#13580](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13580))

## 0.9.0 (March 15, 2017)

**This is the complete 0.8.8 to 0.9 CHANGELOG. Below this section we also have a 0.9.0-beta2 to 0.9.0 final CHANGELOG.**

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

 * provider/aws: `aws_codebuild_project` renamed `timeout` to `build_timeout` ([#12503](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12503))
 * provider/azurem: `azurerm_virtual_machine` and `azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set` now store has of custom_data not all custom_data ([#12214](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12214))
 * provider/azurerm: scale_sets `os_profile_master_password` now marked as sensitive
 * provider/azurerm: sql_server `administrator_login_password` now marked as sensitive
 * provider/dnsimple: Provider has been upgraded to APIv2 therefore, you will need to use the APIv2 auth token

 * provider/google: compute_instance, compute_instance_template, and compute_disk all have a subtly changed logic when specifying an image family as the image; in 0.8.x they would pin to the latest image in the family when the resource is created; in 0.9.x they pass the family to the API and use its behaviour. New input formats are also supported. ([#12223](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12223))
 * provider/google: removed the unused and deprecated region field from google_compute_backend_service ([#12663](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12663))

## 0.9.0-beta1 (February 15, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

 * Once an environment is updated to use the new "remote backend" feature
   (from a prior remote state), it cannot be used with prior Terraform versions.

 * provider/aws: `aws_rds_cluster` now defaults to making a final snapshot on delete
 * provider/aws: `aws_redshift_cluster` now defaults to making a final snapshot on delete
 * provider/aws: Deprecated fields `kinesis_endpoint` & `dynamodb_endpoint` were removed. Use `kinesis` & `dynamodb` inside the `endpoints` block instead. ([#11778](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11778))
 * provider/datadog: `datadog_monitor` now defaults `notify_no_data` to `false` as per the datadog API

FEATURES:

 * **Remote Backends:** This is a successor to "remote state" and includes
   file-based configuration, an improved setup process (just run `terraform init`),
   no more local caching of remote state, and more. ([#11286](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11286))

   on resource destruction. ([#11329](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11329))

   Backends supporting locking in this release are Local, S3 (via DynamoDB), and Consul. ([#11187](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11187))

IMPROVEMENTS:

 * core: Data source values can now be used as part of a `count` calculation. ([#11482](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11482))
 * command: CLI args can be specified via env vars. Specify `TF_CLI_ARGS` or `TF_CLI_ARGS_name` (where name is the name of a command) to specify additional CLI args ([#11922](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11922))
 * command/init: previous behavior is retained, but init now also configures
   the new remote backends as well as downloads modules. It is the single
   command to initialize a new or existing Terraform configuration.
 * provisioners: All provisioners now respond very quickly to interrupts for
