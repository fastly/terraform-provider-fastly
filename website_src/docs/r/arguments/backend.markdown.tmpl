### backend block

The `backend` block supports:

* `name` - (Required, string) Name for this Backend. Must be unique to this Service.
* `address` - (Required, string) An IPv4, hostname, or IPv6 address for the Backend.
* `auto_loadbalance` - (Optional, boolean) Denotes if this Backend should be
included in the pool of backends that requests are load balanced against.
Default `true`.
* `between_bytes_timeout` - (Optional) How long to wait between bytes in milliseconds. Default `10000`.
* `connect_timeout` - (Optional) How long to wait for a timeout in milliseconds.
Default `1000`
* `error_threshold` - (Optional) Number of errors to allow before the Backend is marked as down. Default `0`.
* `first_byte_timeout` - (Optional) How long to wait for the first bytes in milliseconds. Default `15000`.
* `max_conn` - (Optional) Maximum number of connections for this Backend.
Default `200`.
* `port` - (Optional) The port number on which the Backend responds. Default `80`.
* `override_host` - (Optional) The hostname to override the Host header.
{{ if eq .Data.ServiceType "vcl"}}* `request_condition` - (Optional, string) Name of already defined `condition`, which if met, will select this backend during a request.{{end}}
* `use_ssl` - (Optional) Whether or not to use SSL to reach the backend. Default `false`.
* `max_tls_version` - (Optional) Maximum allowed TLS version on SSL connections to this backend.
* `min_tls_version` - (Optional) Minimum allowed TLS version on SSL connections to this backend.
* `ssl_ciphers` - (Optional) Comma separated list of OpenSSL Ciphers to try when negotiating to the backend.
* `ssl_ca_cert` - (Optional) CA certificate attached to origin.
* `ssl_client_cert` - (Optional) Client certificate attached to origin. Used when connecting to the backend.
* `ssl_client_key` - (Optional) Client key attached to origin. Used when connecting to the backend.
* `ssl_check_cert` - (Optional) Be strict about checking SSL certs. Default `true`.
* `ssl_hostname` - (Optional, deprecated by Fastly) Used for both SNI during the TLS handshake and to validate the cert.
* `ssl_cert_hostname` - (Optional) Overrides ssl_hostname, but only for cert verification. Does not affect SNI at all.
* `ssl_sni_hostname` - (Optional) Overrides ssl_hostname, but only for SNI in the handshake. Does not affect cert validation at all.
* `shield` - (Optional) The POP of the shield designated to reduce inbound load. Valid values for `shield` are included in the [`GET /datacenters`](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/api/utils/datacenter/) API response.
* `weight` - (Optional) The [portion of traffic](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/load-balancing-configuration#how-weight-affects-load-balancing) to send to this Backend. Each Backend receives `weight / total` of the traffic. Default `100`.
* `healthcheck` - (Optional) Name of a defined `healthcheck` to assign to this backend.
