### package block

The `package` block supports uploading or modifying Wasm packages for use in a Fastly Compute@Edge service. See Fastly's documentation on
[Compute@Edge](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless)

* `filename` - (Required) The path to the Wasm deployment package within your local filesystem.
* `source_code_hash` - (Optional) Used to trigger updates. Must be set to a SHA512 hash of the package file specified with the filename. The usual way to set this is filesha512("package.tar.gz") (Terraform 0.11.12 and later) or filesha512(file("package.tar.gz")) (Terraform 0.11.11 and earlier), where "package.tar.gz" is the local filename of the Wasm deployment package.
